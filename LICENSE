FFP-NBD License (Freedom For Profit - No Being a Dick)
Version 1.0

TL;DR: Use this software to build cool shit, make bank, and have fun. Just don’t be a dick about it—give credit, don’t scam, and play nice. If you can’t handle that, fuck off.

Fallback License
If this license gets shredded by some suit-wearing lawyer, it defaults to the MIT License. Check it out at https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

The FFP-NBD License lets you do whatever the fuck you want with this software. You can profit, tinker, or impress your friends. But here’s the deal: don’t be a fucking dick. We’re all here to create and share, so don’t ruin it by being a selfish prick. Be a decent human.

Definitions
- Software: The code, docs, or other stuff under this license. Only covers what’s original to this project—other bits might have their own rules.
- Author: The badass who did some work and found it in their heart to share it with you. They’re a Reasonable Person (probably).
- Reasonable Person: Someone who respects the effort behind this software, gives credit where it's due, and doesn’t act like an asshole. They use, tweak, or share without fucking over the community.
- Dick: A jerk who shits on everyone’s good time by:
    - Scamming or harming others with the Software
    - Stealing credit or pretending they wrote this shit themselves.
    - Trolling, harassing, or gatekeeping in community spaces like Discord or GitHub.
    - Demanding the Author’s time on a project he may have not looked at for 10 years and act like a whiny entitled fuck.
    - Talking shit about the Author or contributors personally instead of the work.

Note: “Dick” isn’t about gender—it’s about being an asshole. Anyone can be a dick, so don’t be one.

Permissions (For Non-Dicks)

If you’re a Reasonable Person, you can:

- Use, copy, tweak, or merge the Software for any damn thing you want.
- Sell it, build a startup, or slap it on a blockchain (good luck, bro).
- Share it, but give a shoutout to the Author. Don’t be a stingy fuck.
- Join or start communities around the Software—just don’t be a prick about it.
- Critique it, but keep it about the work, not personal bullshit.
- Toss a link to the original in your README if you’re feeling classy (not required).
- Ignore the Software completely. Your call, no pressure.

If you’re a Dick you are strictly forbidden to:

- Use this to fuck people over with scams, malware, or other shady shit.
- Steal credit or act like you’re some kind of genius who came up with this yourself
- Troll, harass, or gatekeep in the community. Nobody likes a loudmouth asshole.
- Demand the Author’s time or bug them like a clingy ex.
- Shit-talk the Author or contributors personally.
- Mess with anyone else’s right to use, share, or ignore this Software.

No Warranty
This Software is “as is.” If it crashes your laptop, eats your crypto, or summons a demon, that’s your problem. The Author’s not liable for your fuck-ups, so don’t come blaming anyone but yourself.

If You’re a Dick
No one can legally stop you from being an asshole, but if you violate the “No Being a Dick” rule

Final Words
